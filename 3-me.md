# Algorithm Analysis

- asymptotic algorithm analysis

---

- The “coding efficiency” of the programmer who converts the algorithm to a program can have a tremendous impact as well.
- T(n), a given input size n we often express the time T.
  - T(n) must always be non-negative.
  - T(n) = c, constant running time
- best case, average case, worst case
